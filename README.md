# Cathedral-and-the-Bazaar-of-Software-Vulnerabilities

This repository provides the datasets used in our paper for analyzing entry-level and group-level inconsistencies between CNAs and the NVD.  
**Note**: The private CNA dataset (referred to as *Company X*) used in our experiments and analysis is not included in this repository. The scripts provided below operate only on public CNA data obtained from VulnCheck.

---

## Usage

- **Python version**: 3.10.9  
- Make sure the following Python packages are installed: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `openpyxl` (for `.xlsx` files).

## Folder Contents

### ðŸ“‚ Original Dataset

As the files `vulCheck_v31.csv`, `vulCheck_v31_Cleaned.csv`, and `vulCheck_v31_Cleaned_withShortName.csv` are large, we have uploaded each as a separate zip archive.  
Please follow the instructions below to properly extract and use the full dataset and code:

1. **Download** all three zipped CSV files.  
2. **Unzip** them and place the resulting files inside the `Original Dataset` folder.

**Notes:**
- The file `vulCheck_v31_Cleaned.csv` was generated using the preprocessing script `vulCheck_DataPreprocessing.py`. You can regenerate it by uncommenting the save-file line in the script.
- The file `vulCheck_v31_Cleaned_withShortName.csv` was derived from `vulCheck_v31_Cleaned.csv` by manually reviewing and annotating short names for each CNA.

### ðŸ“‚ d Disagreement Metric

Computes the overall disagreement between CNA and NVD CVSS vector assignments using the Hamming distance.

- `hamming_distance.py`: Calculates Hamming distance between each CNA and NVD vector.
- `Hamming_Distance_AllCNA.csv`: Full output of pairwise Hamming distance results. Can be regenerated by uncommenting the save instruction in the script.
- `Median_d_withShortName.csv`: Median disagreement per CNA (used for visualization). Also regenerable via the script.

---

### ðŸ“‚ Per-Metric Disagreement Coefficient (PMDC)

Quantifies how often each CVSS base metric (e.g., AV, AC, PR) differs between CNA and NVD.

- `PMDC.py`: Calculates disagreement rates for each CVSS metric.
- `PMDC_withShortName.csv`: Output file with PMDC scores per CNA. Can be regenerated using `PMDC.py`.

---

### ðŸ“‚ Odds Ratio

Analyzes consistency at the group level using odds ratio based on identical CVE descriptions.

- `odds_ratio.py`: Assigns consistency/inconsistency labels to grouped entries and computes odds ratios.
- `group_labels_withShortName.csv`: Script-generated labels for group-level consistency. Can be regenerated by re-running the script.
- `odds_ratio_withShortName.csv`: Final odds ratio results per CNA.

---

### ðŸ“‚ Entropy

Measures internal consistency for each CNA and the NVD based on Shannon entropy.

- `entropy.py`: Calculates entropy over CVSS vectors grouped by identical descriptions.
- `entropy_withShortName.csv`: Entropy scores per CNA and NVD.

---

### ðŸ“‚ Regression Analysis

Performs statistical modeling to identify factors that influence CNAâ€“NVD disagreements.

- `logistic_regression.py`: Logistic regression model to predict whether a CNA disagrees with NVD.
- `linear_regression.py`: Linear regression model to explain the severity score differences.
- `merged_withVendor_info.csv`: Combines the feature dataset from earlier modules with manually annotated CNA organizational types.  
  Also includes severity comparisons, score differences, indicators of which party assigned a higher score, and whether the score is criticalâ€”potentially useful for future research.
